### Introduction

Stroop Effect is not a fancy game name that I have came out with. The term Stroop effect is actually a simple phenomenon that reveals a lot about how the brain processes information.

### How Was This Made?

With a little inspiration of some HTML games I've played when I was younger, this simple, vibrant game is put together with only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

### How to Play?

You just have to follow the in-game text (not the font colour) given and click on the matching buttons. You will understand once you play it.
